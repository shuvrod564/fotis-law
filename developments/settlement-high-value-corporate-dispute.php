                The case centered on a corporate dispute between shareholders of a globally renowned company with offices, with a branch in the Emirate of Sharjah. We advised one of the English shareholders of the company who was denied payments of dividends in the said branch in Sharjah over the past years. Based on Fotis International’s recommendations, the client commenced litigatory proceedings against the other shareholders of the company before the Court of First Instance in the Emirate of Sharjah. Our firm-initiated proceedings against the opposing party in the Court of First Instance, where the court advised both sides to seek an amicable resolution.

                To our client’s advantage, the opposite party’s legal counsels approached us for an amicable settlement on the matter. Leveraging persistent negotiation efforts, guided by our firm, a resolution was successfully attained after engaging in multiple rounds of settlement discussions. Our Corporate Practice and Dispute Resolution Practice was able to negotiate a positive settlement for our client that included a high value lump sum payment and an installment payment plan as compensation, and a complete restriction placed on the opposite party from utilizing the intellectual property of the company.

                Mr. Marwan Mohamed represented a client in a commercial dispute with an approximate claim value amounting in the millions, wherein the opposing party alleged that such amounts were extorted by our client. Claims were made by the opposite party that our client had acquired the sum through coercive means, despite the funds being transferred within the context of an existing business relationship between both parties. The opposite party accused our client of deploying methods of coercion, threats, and fraudulent actions in the transaction. In response, our firm countered these allegations, submitting a comprehensive defence asserting that the plaintiff's contentions lacked merit and substantial evidence. Throughout the proceedings in the Court of First Instance, and the Court of Appeal, the opposite party failed to substantiate their claims. The courts unanimously ruled to dismiss the case, emphasizing the lack of evidence and credibility in the plaintiff's accusations. Furthermore, the plaintiff was directed to cover expenses and attorneys' fees incurred by our client.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accordingly, the opposite party filed a case against our client before the Court of Cassation, and the case was successfully represented by Mr. Marwan Mohamed. The Court of Cassation rejected the claims of the opposite party and upheld the judgment made by the lower courts, while also granting costs. This is a landmark judgment for the firm and our client, considering the constant attempts by the opposite party.

                    The bankruptcy law in UAE that governs insolvency law and liquidation law identifies a
                    number of ways for avoiding bankruptcy and the liquidation of debtor’s assets, including out-of-court
                    financial restructuring, financial restructuring, composition procedures, and the ability to secure new
                    loans defined by the law. Following the implementation of the UAE bankruptcy law, businessmen will no
                    longer face arrest or legal prosecution for unpaid debts, nor will they have to flee the country to
                    avoid a jail term. Our bankruptcy law firm would ensure that you have our assistance in the legal
                    process of defending yourself and saving your business from bankruptcy.

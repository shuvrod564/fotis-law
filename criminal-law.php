              In the United Arab Emirates, criminal behavior is governed by the Federal Penal Code, whose provisions are largely based on Islamic law. Crimes come in many different forms because, in the modern world, they can cause financial, moral, and physical harm to any individual or group of people. Therefore, in order to provide their client with the best possible counsel, criminal attorneys in Dubai must fully understand the nature of the offense. Our team assists client in cases involving physical violence, domestic violence, crimes against dignity of any being, financial crimes, such as money laundering, loan fraud, cheque bounce, etc., drug trafficking, possession and consumption, sexual crimes, murder or attempt to murder, kidnapping, abduction, assault or any threat, theft, robbery, burglary or trespassing, cyber offenses, consumption of alcohol whilst driving or without license.

              The substantive law and the law of procedures make up the two elements of UAE criminal law, the branch of law that deals with crimes against the public. The UAE Penal Code outlines the legislative requirements that establish what behaviors are considered crimes in the UAE and specifies the punishments that apply to such behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Felonies are the most serious offenses, and the crimes are broken down into three categories: contraventions, misdemeanors, and felonies. Our Dubai Lawyers provide bespoke and effective legal services in these kinds of cases. The Dubai Criminal Court has the authority to jail, fine, and exonerate those accused of committing crimes.

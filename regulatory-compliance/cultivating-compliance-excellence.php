            The importance and need of a thorough understanding of the existent and potential risk cannot be outdone when significant decisions are to be taken and implemented. Similarly, compliance related decisions cannot be devoid of such evaluations either. Being wholly aware of such nexus and recognizing the paramount position any business risk assessment holds in concluding corporate decisions, our Firm caters to the necessity of conducting a detailed risk search and evaluation of business elements (such as (among others) products and services, existing or new business practices, technology, geographical establishment) that could prove to be contributors of potential financial crimes and flag cautions against compliance regimes. Accordingly, we lay out proactive control mechanisms through insights derived at this stage and conclude concrete advisory on what measures need to be adopted.

                    Presumption of innocence is the corner stone of a vast majority of legal systems all around the world. This principle states that anyone accused of a criminal offense is innocent until proven guilty, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is no exception to this legal principle. The UAE Federal Law Number 3 of 1987 (the Penal Code), as well as the UAE Federal Law Number 35 of 1992 (the Criminal Procedure Code), along with their respective amendments, are the main codes regulating the criminal framework in Abu Dhabi.

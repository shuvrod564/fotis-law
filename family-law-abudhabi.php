                    The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is home to over 200 hundred nationalities. Although the vast majority of the population (citizens and residents) is Muslim, the country welcomes several different religions, such as Christians or Hindus. Hence, handling family and (legal) private matters with such a various background is a big challenge, both for the UAE legislator and the UAE attorneys. Abu Dhabi has paved the way by setting the non-Muslim court for family cases.

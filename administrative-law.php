            <p>Our team of administrative lawyers in Dubai specializes in representing clients in numerous matters
                before local
                municipalities, governmental offices (such as the Department of Economic Development, Dubai Land
                Department, Roads, and Transport Authority,
                Federal Tax Authority, etc.). We endeavor to bridge the gap between clients and regulatory bodies to
                ensure that there are no compliance issues in the future. Therefore, another aspect of our
                Administrative Law Practice deals with
                compliance issues.
                <br /><br /> Our administrative lawyers in Abu Dhabi also specialize in advising and representing
                clients on the

                Our team has vast experience in dealing with the governmental bodies and regulatory authorities
                located in different Emirates and this has helped us in formulating a client-oriented approach to understand
                their requirements and issues. The Administrative
                Law Practice at the law firm in Dubai has extensive experience in assisting and advising clients on various
                statutory requirements such as obtaining permits, no objection certificates, building permits, etc. from the
                respective authorities.
                Therefore, this team also closely works with major players in the real estate sector and has absolute
                knowledge of the local regulations that apply to the construction of buildings in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and the
                Northern Emirates.

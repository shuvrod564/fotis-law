            <p>
                Our aviation lawyers in Dubai specialize in a variety of aspects of aerospace and aviation laws in
                the region including accidents, commercial and private chartering, dispute resolution, drones,
                financing, insurance liability and the like. We have a strategic approach to aviation related
                matters considering the vast experience that we hold in international aviation laws and regulations.
                Our lawyers have sector-specific expertise and knowledge of the various technicalities of the
                industry including governmental regulations, international conventions and liability analysis. With
                the involvement of partners in intricate matters, we aim to service aircraft operators, aircraft
                owners, airlines and insurance (and reinsurance) companies in transactional and dispute resolution
                assignments. Our offices, spanning in the Middle East, advise on key domestic and international
                players in the aviation industry including governmental regulators and financial service providers
                such as banks alike. We aim to provide seamless service in structuring and compliance related
                matters, given our proven track record and decades of combined experience of our partners. We also
                assist and advise foreign law firms on domestic regulations and litigation matters at the courts.
            </p> 
            <p class="mt-4">
                Our multi-jurisdictional aviation practice works closely with the senior attorneys in the dispute resolution
                practice on various arbitration, compliance, litigation, and regulatory penalties other matters in the
                region. The prime practice of our aviation lawyers in UAE includes (i) competition laws; (ii) complex crisis
                (or disaster) management including accidental claims, damages, injuries and insurance; (iii) employment
                matters (including lay-off, compensation schemes, pension etc.); (iv) financial aspects such as aircraft
                mortgage, insolvency, Islamic financing, leasing and restructuring; (v) navigation issues; and (vi)
                regulatory compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that legal matters surrounding the aviation sector (both corporate and dispute resolution)
                should be handled by lawyers with professional experience in the industry’s laws, know-how and general
                practices. With that in mind, our lawyers aim to provide bespoke advice and services on aircraft leasing
                arrangements, asset financing, cargo transport, corporate transactions, joint venture, maintenance
                agreements, regulatory licensing and compliance. Our team of lawyers in Sharjah have a long tradition of
                advising and guiding companies in the aviation sector to navigate through various legal and commercial
                issues that they face.

                <div class="brd-top-gold">&nbsp;</div>
                <p class="mt-1">Years later, one of the main issues that the corporate environment of the twenty-first
                    century faces is collection of debt. Suppose you are a manufacturer of let’s say – tomato paste – and
                    you wish to sell your products in the local market. The general payment terms may vary between credit of
                    thirty (30) days to credit of ninety (90) days. This means that your client would pay you post the
                    period from the date of your invoice. However, traits of trade gives rise to numerous issues in such
                    instances. The customer or client may fall bankrupt, they may face legal or compliance related issues,
                    their clients may not pay them etc. Basically, it is an endless world of probabilities and variables.
                    Another issue that clients generally face is the effect that bad debts (or delayed debts) have on the
                    cash flow of business. Companies (especially entities that rely on a cash based revenue model) are
                    generally affected to a larger extent by the failure of their clients to clear their outstanding (or
                    pending) amounts. Therefore, it is pertinent for one to obtain legal advice in order to engage and
                    establish a line of communication with debtors in order to recover funds. Our Dubai lawyers specialize
                    in debt recovery in UAE and have assisted numerous clients to recover their outstanding amounts.</p>

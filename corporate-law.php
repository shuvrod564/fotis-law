                    Our team of highly skilled company and corporate lawyers guides clients with
                    the aim of minimizing (undesirable) annual overhead costs and preferred tax relaxations while evaluating
                    each client’s requirements. Federal Law Number 2 of 2015 is the key statute governing companies’ law in
                    the UAE which is the corporate commercial law. Additionally, we provide guidance and support in the
                    company formation in UAE, setting the best form legal option, such as limited liability company,
                    offshore company, joint venture company, Dubai mainland company, among others. We avoid ambiguous
                    language and draft contracts with a clear purpose and defining the important terms to avoid problems in
                    the future. Our law firm in UAE provides corporate risk evaluation and incorporation, identifying
                    the company’s risks, creating the company’s risk library, recognizing the controls to mitigate and
                    reduce risks and measuring risk potential. On the other hand, concerning the mergers and acquisitions,
                    we facilitate the process by guiding our clients through these decisions. Our clients trust our
                    lawyers and their ability to deal with complex, high-value, sensitive matters and
                    deliver the best possible result.

                    We provide unified legal support with our expertise in the area and experience in the
                    domestic markets especially related to company formation in UAE. The depth of our corporate practice in
                    UAE helps us to counsel clients on intricate cross-border businesses as well as delicate
                    internal structuring matters. Our team of business and commercial lawyers has expanded
